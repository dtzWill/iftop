Things to do for iftop
$Id: TODO,v 1.1 2002/03/28 17:29:42 chris Exp $

* Interface types other than ethernet? Should at least detect these....

* IP types other than v4?

* Which average to use for the bar graph? Show several and peaks? Colours?

* Single keypress firewalling of troublesome connections, a la top(1)'s K
  to kill?

* Aggregate traffic by source host / dest host rather than just by host pair.

* For promiscuous mode, give a way to define which packets are regarded as
  `inside' and which `outside' the network.
