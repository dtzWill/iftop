* Interface types other than ethernet? Should at least detect these....

* IP types other than v4?

* Which average to use for the bar graph? Show several and peaks? Colours?

* Single keypress firewalling of troublesome connections, a la top(1)'s K
  to kill?

* Aggregate traffic by source host / dest host rather than just by host pair.

* Configurable sort criteria.

* Configurable refresh rates.
