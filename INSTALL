$Id: INSTALL,v 1.1 2002/03/29 11:59:44 chris Exp $

1. Modify any settings at the top of the Makefile. Look in particular at PREFIX
   and MANDIR.

2. Compile by typing make.

3. Install by typing make install. You will probably want to do this step as
   root.

You can also use make uninstall to remove iftop and its manual page.
