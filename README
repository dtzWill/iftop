iftop must be run as root.

KNOWN ISSUES

RedHat 7.2:

There is a bug in the version of ncurses distibuted with RedHat 7.2 that
will cause iftop to segfault.  The RPM in RedHat's Rawhide distribution
fixes this.

Slackware 8.1:

You may need to upgrade your libpcap (by updating the tcpdump package) 
in order to compile iftop.

FreeBSD 4.7:

This version of FreeBSD lacks a proper gethostbyaddr_r function. You should
choose an alternative name resolution technique using the --with-resolver=...
option to configure.

Solaris:

On Solaris, libpcap does not capture outgoing packets unless it is run on an
interface in promiscuous mode. Therefore, you will need to use the -p option
to iftop to get sensible results. Cf.
  http://www.tcpdump.org/lists/workers/2002/02/msg00010.html

The version of curses distributed with Solaris may not be sufficient for
iftop's needs. You will probably need ncurses or similar.
