KNOWN ISSUES

RedHat 7.2:

There is a bug in the version of ncurses distibuted with RedHat 7.2 that
will cause iftop to segfault.  The RPM in RedHat's Rawhide distribution
fixes this.

Slackware 8.1:

You may need to upgrade your libpcap (by updating the tcpdump package) 
in order to compile iftop.

FreeBSD 4.7:

DNS resolution does not work due to the lack of a proper gethostbyaddr_r
implementation.
